README means READIT

# sexyslack-ponce-*
Ok, lets make it clear.
This folder (ponce) is almost hidden and not mentioned in sexyslack README.
Slackware dont support binary installation exept from officiall .*t?z builded from PAT.
Thats why even Slackbuilds.org dont have binary repo.
Here you can have a local repo of binnaries from ponce repo which are builded from ponce also.
The reasons to do this is IF you have a potato pc && IF you working offline && IF you are running Slackware-current.
If all these "IF" met, then OK sexyslack-ponce-update and sexyslack-ponce-install is for you and you can take the risk...

### Installation

This time you need more that 2.5G free space in /usr/src/sexyslack/ and all ponce`s *.txz will be there for you. (Gnome is only 255MB)
Then you must chmod +x sexyslack-ponce-update sexyslack-ponce-install
And put them to /usr/local/bin/ 

### Uninstall

rm -r  /usr/src/sexyslack/ponce
rm /usr/local/bin/sexyslack-ponce-update /usr/local/bin/sexyslack-ponce-install


### HOWTO

After installation first run as root
 sexyslack-ponce-update 
It will take some time but after it finish you will have more that 500 packages for installation if needed.
After  sexyslack-ponce-update finish it will ask you if you want to install/upgrade/reinstall to use: 
 sexyslack-ponce-install
 Then you can answer questions for the rest of the job.
 Since ponce repo is not rsync sexyslack-ponce-update use lftp command and every time you run it redownload all ponce repo.
 So every week run sexyslack-ponce-update to have your repo up to day. 
 AND every day you need a package run  sexyslack-ponce-install 
 
 ### NOTE 
1) Installing packages this way you may lose their run-time deps... So if you DONT know if deps are needed at the end a BIG zero (0) will be the resault...
2) To save space and time ONLY *.txz are downloaded from ponce repo. Not even .asc files like Gnome repo
 So you CAN NOT verify package KEYS... If for any logical reason you dont like that (thats the right way) then DONT use it.
 Alternative go to https://ponce.cc/slackware/slackware64-current/packages/ and do the job. Thats why this site is there. 
3) I am a farmer, I work in land and I love Jesus, my children, nature and Slackware. Thats why even my free time I want to be with my laptop but outside...
 Land or sea dont have internet connection most of the times, so sexyslack-ponce* for me is good, until Elon Musk connect trees,Moon and fishes, but for you what is good...only you know :)  
4) You are alone to this trip, none will support or help you when you break your system :)
